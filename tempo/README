### Installation
I assume you have node and npm installed. From there, it's just:
```
npm install
```
and you should end up with a working installation.

### Running
Once you've installed, this is as simple as:
```
node index.js
```
You'll see a multiline prompt where you can enter BOM data line by line.
Remember, this system still lacks validation so weird things may happen if
you don't enter data in the specific formats laid out in the spec. Once you're
done entering data, hit CTRL+C and you'll get hot, fresh JSON.

### Testing
This is just:
```
npm test
```
To run a little integration test I put together. Next steps here might include
unit tests on individual functions within bomToJSON.js.
